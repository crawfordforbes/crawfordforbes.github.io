  descriptionHTML: `<p>In high school I taught myself BASIC on my graphing calculator, and made animated title screens for the games that my friends and I passed around.In college I used MAX/MSP to write a program that played music derived from videos of the board game Othello. In bootcamp instead of doodling in notebooks I would write scripts to create mosaics of shimmering divs. People have been making art with machines and logic forever, I'm just lucky I was born after the advent of MIDI.</p>`
